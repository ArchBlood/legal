Please note the export user data feature works only with enabled module [RESTful API](https://github.com/humhub/rest) and by default it exports the following data from database:
- User data
- Posts
- Comments
- Likes
- Files (also physical files are attached to ZIP archive in the folder `/uploads/`)
